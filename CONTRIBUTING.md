## How to contribute to odl-plastic

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/odl-plastic/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/odl-plastic/issues/new).
  Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, and a **code sample** or an **runner test case** demonstrating
  the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will
generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change in the [odl-plastic mailing list](https://lists.opendaylight.org/g/plastic) and start writing code.
